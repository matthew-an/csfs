One of the most common questions we hear from New Zealanders is: "Do I need private health insurance if I have ACC?" It's a great question, and the answer isn't as straightforward as you might think.

## Understanding New Zealand's Healthcare System

New Zealand has a unique healthcare system that combines:
- **Public healthcare** through district health boards
- **ACC** for accident-related injuries
- **Private health insurance** for additional coverage

## What ACC Covers

ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) provides comprehensive coverage for:
- **Accident-related injuries** only
- Medical treatment costs
- Rehabilitation services
- Income replacement (80% of earnings)
- Lump sum payments for permanent impairment

### What ACC Doesn't Cover
- **Illness or disease** (non-accident related)
- Elective surgery waiting times
- Private hospital accommodation
- Choice of specialist or surgeon

## What Private Health Insurance Covers

Private health insurance fills the gaps left by ACC and public healthcare:
- **Illness and disease** treatment
- Faster access to specialists
- Private hospital treatment
- Choice of surgeon and timing
- Additional services like dental and optical

## Why Many Choose Both

The combination of ACC and private health insurance provides:
- **Complete coverage** for both accidents and illness
- **Faster treatment** for non-urgent conditions
- **Peace of mind** knowing you're fully protected
- **Financial security** during health challenges

## Making the Right Choice

The decision depends on your:
- Health history and risk factors
- Financial situation
- Personal preferences for healthcare
- Family medical needs
