Imagine this scenario: You're 35 years old, earning $75,000 per year, with a mortgage, car loan, and family to support. Suddenly, a serious illness or injury prevents you from working for six months, a year, or even permanently. How would you maintain your lifestyle and meet your financial obligations?

This is where income protection insurance becomes your financial lifeline.

## What is Income Protection Insurance?

Income protection insurance provides you with a regular income (typically 75% of your pre-tax salary) if you become unable to work due to illness or injury. Unlike ACC, which only covers accidents, income protection covers both accidents and illnesses.

## Why You Need Income Protection

### The Statistics Are Sobering
- 1 in 4 people will be unable to work for 90 days or more before age 65
- The average claim lasts 2.5 years
- Most people have less than 3 months of expenses saved

### Your Biggest Asset
Your ability to earn an income is likely your most valuable asset. For a 30-year-old earning $60,000 annually, their lifetime earning potential is approximately $2.4 million. Protecting this asset is crucial.

## How Income Protection Works

### Coverage Options
- **Short-term**: Covers you for up to 2 years
- **Long-term**: Can cover you until retirement age
- **Stepped vs Level premiums**: Choose between increasing premiums or fixed costs

### Benefit Periods
- **2 years**: Suitable for short-term protection
- **5 years**: Good middle ground
- **To age 65**: Maximum protection for your working life

## Getting the Right Cover

The key is finding the right balance between coverage and affordability. Our experienced advisors can help you navigate the options and find a policy that fits your needs and budget.
