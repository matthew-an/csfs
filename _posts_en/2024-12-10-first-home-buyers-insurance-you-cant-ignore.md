Congratulations! You've navigated New Zealand's competitive property market and are about to become a first-time homeowner. Between saving for the deposit, securing a mortgage, and dealing with lawyers and real estate agents, insurance might be the last thing on your mind.

But here's the reality: your new home represents the largest financial commitment you'll likely ever make. Without proper insurance protection, you could lose everything you've worked so hard to achieve.

## Essential Insurance Types for First Home Buyers

### 1. Home and Contents Insurance
This is non-negotiable. Your mortgage lender will require buildings insurance, but you should also consider:
- **Full replacement cover** for your home
- **Contents insurance** for your belongings
- **Natural disaster coverage** including earthquakes and floods

### 2. Mortgage Protection Insurance
If something happens to you, mortgage protection insurance can:
- Pay off your remaining mortgage balance
- Ensure your family can keep the home
- Provide peace of mind during uncertain times

### 3. Income Protection Insurance
This covers your mortgage payments if you can't work due to illness or injury:
- Typically covers 75% of your income
- Payments can continue for years if needed
- Essential for maintaining your lifestyle and mortgage payments
