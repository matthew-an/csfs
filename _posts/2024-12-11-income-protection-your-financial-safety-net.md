Imagine this scenario: You're 35 years old, earning $75,000 per year, with a mortgage, car loan, and family to support. Suddenly, a serious illness or injury prevents you from working for six months, a year, or even permanently. How would you maintain your lifestyle and meet your financial obligations?

This is where income protection insurance becomes your financial lifeline. Yet, it's one of the most overlooked types of insurance in New Zealand, despite being arguably one of the most important.

## What is Income Protection Insurance?

Income protection insurance (also called salary protection or disability insurance) provides you with a regular income if you're unable to work due to illness or injury. It's designed to replace a portion of your lost earnings, helping you maintain your standard of living during recovery.

### How It Works

1. **You pay regular premiums** (monthly, quarterly, or annually)
2. **If you become unable to work** due to covered illness or injury
3. **After a waiting period** (typically 30 days to 2 years)
4. **You receive monthly payments** (usually 75% of your pre-disability income)
5. **Payments continue** until you can return to work, reach retirement age, or the policy term ends

## Why Income Protection Matters in New Zealand

### The Statistics Are Sobering

- **1 in 3 New Zealanders** will be off work for 3+ months due to illness or injury before age 65
- **Mental health claims** account for 40% of income protection claims
- **Musculoskeletal conditions** (back, neck injuries) make up 25% of claims
- **Cancer** affects 1 in 3 New Zealanders during their lifetime
- **Average claim duration** is 2-3 years

### The Financial Reality

Most New Zealanders live paycheck to paycheck:
- **57% have less than $1,000** in emergency savings
- **Average household debt** is $261,000 (including mortgages)
- **Monthly expenses** continue even when income stops

### Limited Safety Nets

New Zealand's social safety net has gaps:
- **ACC**: Only covers accidents, not illness
- **Jobseeker Support**: $315-$400 per week maximum (with strict criteria)
- **Sick leave**: Most employees get only 10 days per year
- **Employer benefits**: Vary widely, often limited

## Types of Income Protection

### 1. Agreed Value vs Indemnity

**Agreed Value**:
- Benefit amount agreed when you apply
- Based on your income at application time
- Guaranteed payout regardless of income changes
- More expensive but provides certainty

**Indemnity**:
- Benefit based on actual income loss
- Requires proof of income at claim time
- Less expensive premiums
- Payout may be less if income has decreased

### 2. Own Occupation vs Any Occupation

**Own Occupation**:
- Pays if you can't perform your specific job
- Best protection for professionals and specialists
- More expensive but comprehensive coverage
- Example: Surgeon who can't operate but could do office work

**Any Occupation**:
- Only pays if you can't work in any job suited to your education and experience
- Less expensive but more restrictive
- Harder to qualify for benefits
- Example: Must be unable to do any reasonable work

### 3. Short-term vs Long-term

**Short-term (1-2 years)**:
- Covers temporary disabilities
- Lower premiums
- Shorter waiting periods (14-90 days)
- Good for covering immediate needs

**Long-term (to age 65)**:
- Covers permanent or long-term disabilities
- Higher premiums but crucial protection
- Longer waiting periods (90 days-2 years)
- Essential for serious conditions

## Key Features to Consider

### Waiting Periods (Elimination Periods)

This is how long you must be disabled before benefits begin:

**Common Options**:
- **30 days**: Higher premiums, immediate support
- **90 days**: Balanced option for most people
- **180 days**: Lower premiums, requires substantial savings
- **365 days**: Lowest premiums, significant financial risk

**Choosing Your Waiting Period**:
- Consider your emergency savings
- Factor in sick leave entitlements
- Balance premium costs with risk tolerance

### Benefit Periods

How long payments continue:

**Options**:
- **2 years**: Covers most temporary disabilities
- **5 years**: Good middle ground
- **To age 65**: Maximum protection for permanent disabilities
- **Lifetime**: Rare but available for some conditions

### Indexation (Cost of Living Adjustments)

**CPI Indexation**: Benefits increase with inflation
**Fixed Increases**: Set percentage increases (e.g., 3% annually)
**No Indexation**: Benefits stay the same (purchasing power decreases)

### Partial and Residual Benefits

**Partial Disability**: Can work but with reduced capacity
**Residual Benefits**: Proportional payments based on income loss
**Return to Work Benefits**: Incentives to return to work gradually

## Income Protection Costs in New Zealand

### Factors Affecting Premiums

1. **Age**: Older applicants pay more
2. **Gender**: Women typically pay more (longer life expectancy, higher claim rates)
3. **Occupation**: Higher-risk jobs cost more
4. **Health**: Medical conditions increase premiums
5. **Smoking**: Smokers pay significantly more
6. **Benefit amount**: Higher coverage costs more
7. **Waiting period**: Shorter periods cost more

## Maximizing Your Coverage

### 1. Calculate the Right Benefit Amount

**Monthly Expenses Method**:
- List all monthly expenses
- Include mortgage/rent, utilities, food, insurance, loans
- Add 10-20% buffer for unexpected costs
- This is your minimum benefit need

**Income Replacement Method**:
- Most policies cover 75% of gross income
- Consider tax implications (benefits may be tax-free)
- Factor in reduced work-related expenses

**Example Calculation**:
- Gross monthly income: $7,000
- Net monthly income: $5,500
- Monthly expenses: $4,800
- Recommended benefit: $4,500-$5,000/month

### 2. Choose the Right Waiting Period

**If you have**:
- 3+ months emergency savings → Consider 90-180 day wait
- Generous sick leave → Longer wait period acceptable
- Limited savings → Choose 30-60 day wait
- High monthly expenses → Shorter wait period crucial

### 3. Optimize Your Policy Structure

**Stepped vs Level Premiums**:
- **Stepped**: Increase with age, lower initial cost
- **Level**: Fixed for policy term, higher initial cost but better long-term value

**Guaranteed vs Reviewable Premiums**:
- **Guaranteed**: Cannot be increased (except for indexation)
- **Reviewable**: Insurer can adjust based on claims experience

## Tax Implications

### Premium Deductibility

- **Superannuation**: Premiums through super may have tax advantages

### Benefit Taxation
