### Commissions

  To ensure that advice remains accessible, there is no charge of an upfront fee for providing personal risk insurance advice or for implementing advice if you decide to proceed.
  In place of an upfront fee, I am paid a commission by the recommended insurance provider from the premium they charge you for your cover. This commission will range from 30% to 200% of the first year's premium, depending on which insurance company you take out cover with. Fees are only applicable in rare circumstances if pre-agreed and signed off by you. I will then receive a servicing commission of a fixed annual fee which is 5%-10% of the annual premium for the life of the policy.
